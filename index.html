             <h2>Choose a Colour Scheme and Stick to It</h2>
        <section class="head">
             <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img style="height: 473px; width: 788px" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/4781/3575/files/Use-a-well-thought-out-colour-scheme.jpg?v=1651160427" alt="Palma Brava Home Furnishings and Accessories">    
             </div>
             <p>Did you know that something as simple as the colour of a room can make it feel more or less cluttered?  Typically, you want the rooms in your house to incorporate colours that are similar but not too similar. However, it goes without saying that that is often easier said than done.</p>
             <p>In fact, a lot of people find choosing paint colours to be one of the most daunting parts of decorating their home. But it doesn't need to be. You just need to follow these three easy steps:
             <ul>
                <li>Pick out 3-4 different paint swatches</li>
                <li>Put them up on your wall in different areas (a place where there's natural light coming through would work best) and see what they look like together</li> 
                <li>Consider whether each colour makes you feel happy, peaceful, or both.</li> 
             </ul></p>
             <p>If you're not sure what colours go well together, you can always ask a sales associate at the paint store for help. They'll be more than happy to walk you through the process and give you some tips.</p>

            <h2>Ensure That You Have Enough Storage</h2>
            <p>Do you ever feel like there isn’t enough space in your house to put all of your things? You have boxes and bags stored around the house and they never seem to be empty. It feels like no matter how much storage space you have, it is always full. This can cause a lot of frustration because it takes up so much time to find what you are looking for.</p>
            <p>The solution may be as simple as adding more storage spaces or making better use of the ones that already exist. Storage doesn’t need to cost a lot either; with just a few adjustments, many people can create more room for their belongings without spending any money at all</p>

             <h2>Hang Artwork and Other Decorative Items on The Wall Instead of Using Shelves</h2>
              <p>When your home is full of knick-knacks and decorative items, it can be hard to feel like you have any space to yourself. All of that stuff takes up valuable visual real estate, leaving you with little room to breathe.</p>
              <p>One way to combat this feeling of being overwhelmed is to move some of those decorative items from shelves onto the walls. This will free up space on your shelves and make your home feel less cluttered.</p>
              <p>Plus, hanging <a href="https://palmabrava.com/collections/wall-art"> <u>artwork</u></a> or other wall decor items on the walls instead of putting them on shelves can add a touch of personality to your home. If you have a wall mirror, that can also be a way to make your space feel less cluttered. However, it’s important not to fill your walls with too many things, or your space will quickly go back to feeling cluttered.</p>

             <h2>Regularly Purge Your Home of Items You No Longer Need</h2>
        <section class="head">
             <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img style="height: 473px; width: 788px" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/4781/3575/files/Decluttering-can-open-up-your-living-space.jpg?v=1651160566" alt="Palma Brava Home Furnishings and Accessories">    
             </div>
             <p>Is your home full of things that you no longer want or need? If so, it’s time to do something about that. The benefits of regularly purging your home of unused and unwanted items are twofold.</p>
             <p>Not only does it reduce the amount of clutter in your home, but it also helps you to get rid of unnecessary expenses. For example, if you have a lot of extra accessories and knick-knacks lying around your house, you may be tempted to buy new ones when you see them at the store. But by getting rid of these excess items, you'll be less likely to buy unnecessary things.</p>
             <p>Another benefit of purging is that it can help you to simplify your life. When you have fewer things to worry about, you'll likely find that life is a lot less <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-cost-of-clutter-3144688"> <u>stressful.</u></a></p>

             <h2>Rearrange Your Furniture</h2>
             <p>The easiest way to create more space in your home is by rearranging your furniture. This doesn't mean that you have to get rid of all of your furniture and start from scratch — in fact, you probably won't have to get rid of anything at all. All you need to do is move some pieces around and see what looks best.</p>
             <p>As you're rearranging your furniture, keep in mind how you want your space to function. For example, if you want your living room to be a place where you can relax and entertain guests, arrange your furniture accordingly.</p>

             <h2>Use Natural Materials in Your Home Decor</h2>
             <p>Using natural materials in your home decor can help to create a more minimalist and clutter-free space. This is because natural materials are simple and clean-lined, which helps to create the illusion of more space.</p>
             <p>Additionally, using natural materials in your decorating scheme can help to make your home feel more peaceful and Zen-like. So, if you're looking for ways to declutter your home and create a minimalist space that you love, using natural materials is definitely a good place to start.</p>
